Please read these guidance notes taken directly from UK Health and Safety Executive advice on manual handling and then sign to say that you have read and understood them. Please ask a team member for help and don’t take on a task you cannot manage.</p><hr/><p>Manual handling causes over a third of all workplace injuries. These include work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) such as pain and injuries to arms, legs and joints, and repetitive strain injuries of various sorts. The term manual handling covers a wide variety of activities including lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling and carrying. If any of these tasks are not carried out appropriately there is a risk of injury.</p><h2>Why is dealing with manual handling important?</h2><p>Manual handling injuries can have serious implications. They can occur almost anywhere in the workplace and heavy manual labour, awkward postures, repetitive movements of arms, legs and back or previous/existing injury can increase the risk. </p><h2>What do I have to do?</h2><p>To help prevent manual handling injuries in the workplace, you should avoid such tasks as far as possible. Does the item really need to be moved or can the activity be done safely where it is by redesigning the task? Can products or materials be delivered directly to where they will be used?
Where it is not possible to avoid handling a load, for any lifting activity always take into account:</p><p>• your capability
• the nature of the load
• environmental conditions
• training
• work organisation</p><p>If you need to lift something manually:</p><ol><li>Reduce the amount of twisting, stooping and reaching</li><li>Avoid lifting from floor level or above shoulder height, especially heavy loads</li><li>Adjust storage areas to minimise the need to carry out such movements</li><li>Consider how you can minimise carrying distances</li><li>Assess the weight to be carried and whether you can move the load safely or need any help – maybe the load can be broken down to smaller, lighter components</li><li>Consider whether you can use a lifting aid, such as a trolley</li><li>Think about storage as part of the delivery process – maybe heavy items could be delivered directly, or closer, to the storage area</li><li>Reduce carrying distances where possible</li></ol><h2>Good handling techniques for lifting</h2><p><strong>Think before lifting/handling</strong>. Plan the lift. Can handling aids be used? Where is the load going to be placed? Will help be needed with the load? Remove obstructions from the route such as discarded wrapping materials. For a long lift, consider resting the load midway on a table or bench to change grip.</p><p><strong>Adopt a stable position</strong>. The feet should be apart with one leg slightly forward to maintain balance (alongside the load, if it is on the ground). Be prepared to move your feet during the lift to maintain your stability. Avoid tight clothing or unsuitable footwear, which may make this difficult.</p><p><strong>Get a good hold</strong>. Where possible, the load should be hugged as close as possible to the body. This may be better than gripping it tightly with hands only. Start in a good posture. At the start of the lift, slight bending of the back, hips and knees is preferable to fully flexing the back (stooping) or fully flexing the hips and knees (squatting).</p><p><strong>Don’t flex the back any further while lifting</strong>. This can happen if the legs begin to straighten before starting to raise the load.</p><p><strong>Keep the load close to the waist</strong>. Keep the load close to the body for as long as possible while lifting. Keep the heaviest side of the load next to the body. If a close approach to the load is not possible, try to slide it towards the body before attempting to lift it.</p><p><strong>Avoid twisting the back or leaning sideways</strong>, especially while the back is bent. Shoulders should be kept level and facing in the same direction as the hips. Turning by moving the feet is better than twisting and lifting at the same time.</p><p><strong>Keep the head up when handling</strong>. Look ahead, not down at the load, once it has been held securely.</p><p><strong>Move smoothly</strong>. The load should not be jerked or snatched as this can make it harder to keep control and can increase the risk of injury.</p><p><strong>Don’t lift or handle more than can be easily managed</strong>. There is a difference between what you can lift and what you can safely lift. If in doubt, seek advice or get help.</p><p><strong>Put down, then adjust</strong>. If precise positioning of the load is necessary, put it down first, then slide it into the desired position.</p><hr/><p>During our work we may take photos which we’ll use on social media and other marketing activities. We’ll assume you consent to this unless you inform us otherwise.
I have read and understood these guidance notes. I have made the team aware of any pre-existing complaints that may restrict me from certain physical activities.</p><p>Signature:<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>___</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p>Name:<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> Date: <strong><em>/</em></strong>/___</p><h2>Safeguarding Children Policy</h2><h2>Introduction</h2><p>1 Haringey Fixers a not-for-profit organisation run by:</p><p>Chris Setz as Chairperson, Caesar Labolo as Secretary and Friedrich Ernst as Treasurer</p><p>2 We are based at: 53 Debden N17 6LN</p><p>3 We are managed by our Officers (the Team). One Officer (Mr Chris Setz) has particular responsibility for safeguarding children.</p><p>4 The Team has adopted this safeguarding children policy and expects every adult working or helping us to support it and comply with it. Consequently this policy shall apply to all staff, managers, trustees, directors, volunteers, students or anyone working on behalf of Haringey Fixers.</p><h2>Purpose of the Policy</h2><p>1 This policy is intended to protect children and young people who receive any service from us, including those who are the children of adults who may receive services from us.</p><p>2 As an organisation we believe that no child or young person should experience abuse or harm and are committed to the protection of children and young people and this policy is intended to provide guidance and overarching principles to those who represent us as volunteers or staff, to guide our approach to child protection and safeguarding.</p><h2>The risks to children</h2><p>Nearly every child grows up in a safe and happy environment and it is important not to exaggerate or overestimate the dangers. Nevertheless, there are situations where children need protection including:</p><div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="text"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">* Sexual abuse
* Grooming
* Physical and emotional abuse and neglect
* Domestic violence
* Inappropriate supervision by staff or volunteers
* Bullying, cyber bullying, acts of violence and aggression within our schools and campuses
* Victimisation
* Self-harm
* Unsafe environments and activities
* Crime
* Exploitation</code></pre></div><h2>Universality of Protection</h2><p>We recognise that:</p><div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="text"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">* the welfare of the child is paramount
* all children regardless of race, gender, religious belief, disability, age, sexual orientation or identity have a right to equal protection from harm.
* some children are more vulnerable to harm as a result of their circumstances, prior experiences, communication needs or level of dependency.
* working with children, young people, their parents and/or guardians, carers or other agencies is essential to protecting their wellbeing.</code></pre></div><h2>Safeguarding children at events / activities</h2><p>1 There are three kinds of events/activities:</p><ul><li>1.1 those open to adults and children of all ages,</li><li>1.2 those for children accompanied by a ‘parent’,</li><li>1.3 those for unaccompanied children, which are sometimes run alongside other events/activities.</li></ul><p>2 At events and activities open to all ages, children under 16 must be accompanied throughout by an adult over the age of 18 who not only brings the child but also takes the child home again afterwards. Young people aged 16 or 17 may attend unaccompanied if they bring the written consent and mobile telephone number of one of their parents.</p><p>3 At events and activities for children accompanied by a ‘parent’, children under 16 must be supervised throughout the event by an adult over the age of 18 who not only brings the child to the event but also takes the child home again afterwards. If a lone adult brings more than one child, then the children will have to stay together, so that the one adult can supervise them. Young people aged 16 or 17 may attend unaccompanied if they bring the written consent and mobile telephone number of one of their parents.</p><p>4 At events and activities for unaccompanied children, children under the age of 16 must be enrolled by a responsible adult before being left with the event leader. The enrolment must record the child’s name, age and address and the names and addresses of the child’s parents, plus the parents’ mobile telephone numbers. Young people aged 16 or 17 may attend unaccompanied if they bring the written consent and mobile telephone number of one of their parents.</p><p>5 Both events and activities are to be defined broadly to include any occasions where Haringey Fixers will be providing a service.</p><h2>Disclosure and barring</h2><p>1 We offer the following activities for children:</p><p>A Repair Café and skill share.</p><p>2 Some of our activities may therefore require adult participants or adult leaders to undergo DBS and/or police checks under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. The required level of checking (if any) will broadly reflect the degree and frequency of unsupervised access given to other people’s children.</p><p>3 The Team will take very seriously any allegation of impropriety on the part of any member of Haringey Fixers. A member of Haringey Fixers who discovers anything amiss should get in touch immediately with the following:</p><p>Mr Chris Setz</p><p>4 The Team will review the allegation and the likely risk to children and, if appropriate, will consider banning the member from future events or revoking his or her membership or both, but only in full accordance with the rules and procedures of Haringey Fixers.</p><h2>Health and safety aspects of safeguarding children</h2><p>1 Before starting any event for unaccompanied children, the Team will carry out a risk assessment and then take steps to minimise all risks to health and safety. Parents and children will be made aware of any particular risks and of the steps to be taken to minimise those risks. The Team will keep a record of all risk assessments.</p><p>2 Sufficient adults must be present at any event for unaccompanied children to enable one adult to deal with any emergency while another adult supervises the children not directly affected by the emergency.</p><h2>Policy on the prevention of bullying</h2><p>We will not tolerate the bullying of children either by adults or by other children. If any incident of child-on-child bullying should arise at a Haringey Fixers event, those involved will be separated immediately and the parents of the children involved will be asked to deal with the matter. The Team will review all incidents of child-on-child bullying and assess the likely future risk to children. If appropriate, the Team will consider banning a child from future events, but only in full accordance with the rules and procedures of Haringey Fixers. Allegations of adults bullying children will be dealt with under paragraph 3 above.</p><h2>Photographing children</h2><p>No photos will be taken or published of any child attending an event or activity unless prior written permission is sought from a person with parental responsibility. If any person has any concerns regarding any person taking photos at an event or activity, that person should contact Haringey Fixers immediately.</p><h2>Managing behaviour, discipline and acceptable restraint</h2><p>1 Adults supervising children at Haringey Fixers events must never use any form of corporal punishment. If physical restraint is absolutely necessary to prevent injury to any person or to prevent serious damage to property, then the minimum necessary restraint may be used — but for that purpose only.</p><p>2 Unacceptable behaviour at Haringey Fixers events for unaccompanied children will generally be stopped by separating the children from each other and from the group. The miscreants will be suitably supervised and will be returned as soon as possible to the care of their parents.</p><p>3 Haringey Fixers may apply a further disciplinary sanction; namely the banning of the child from one or more future events over the following 18 months. Any such sanction would be determined and applied by the following officer:</p><p>Mr Chris Setz</p><p>4 A parent who is aggrieved by this ban may appeal to Haringey Fixers who will hear the views of all relevant persons. The decision of Haringey Fixers is then final. </p><h2>Legal Framework</h2><p>This policy has been drawn up in accordance with the following:</p><div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="text"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">* Children Act 1989
